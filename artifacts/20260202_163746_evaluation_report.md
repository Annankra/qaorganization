--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 8/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission demonstrates comprehensive coverage of functional accessibility testing on the login screen and provides a thorough analysis across security, performance, and regression testing. However, it could benefit from specific vulnerability assessments tied to actual codebases and expanded coverage of accessibility features.
Feedback: Enhance functional test scenarios by including broader accessibility features such as voice control and alternative input methods, and ensure mobile device compatibility., Conduct targeted SAST analysis on the actual application code to identify specific vulnerabilities and enhance the security audit's effectiveness.
