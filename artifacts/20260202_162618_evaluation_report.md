--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 8/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission effectively addresses keyboard navigation and accessibility for the login screen with comprehensive functional scenarios and a focused regression analysis. However, it lacks coverage for additional accessibility features such as voice commands and mobile interactions, which could enhance usability for all users.
Feedback: Expand functional test scenarios to include voice command accessibility and mobile device interactions to ensure comprehensive usability., Include tests for other application areas that might be affected by accessibility changes to maintain system-wide consistency.
