--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 8/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission provides a well-rounded approach to testing the accessibility of the login screen, covering functional scenarios, security considerations, and potential vulnerabilities. It effectively uses the STRIDE model for threat analysis and provides clear remediation steps. However, it could benefit from broader accessibility testing and targeted security assessments on the actual codebase.
Feedback: Enhance functional test scenarios by including additional accessibility features such as alternative input methods and ensure they are tested for mobile compatibility., Conduct a detailed Static Application Security Testing (SAST) analysis on the actual application code to identify and address specific vulnerabilities.
