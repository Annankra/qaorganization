--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 7/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission effectively incorporates a staged load testing approach to evaluate system performance under increasing load. However, it lacks baseline testing for comparison and detailed logging to diagnose failure points. These gaps limit the ability to fully understand and optimize performance.
Feedback: Incorporate a baseline load test stage to establish standard performance metrics and identify degradation as load increases., Enhance logging and monitoring during load tests to capture detailed error messages and metrics, facilitating better diagnostics and optimization.
