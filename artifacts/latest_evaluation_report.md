--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 8/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission delivers a thorough set of functional test scenarios for the FIRE-2 Login screen, covering essential user interactions, error handling, and usability. However, it falls short in providing detailed security testing and performance evaluation, which are crucial for ensuring the system's resilience against vulnerabilities and its capability to handle load effectively.
Feedback: Enhance security testing by incorporating scenarios for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF, and ensure that session management is robust., Include performance testing to assess how the system behaves under high load conditions and ensure the login screen can handle peak user traffic without degradation.
