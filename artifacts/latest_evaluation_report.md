--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 7/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission delivers a detailed set of functional test scenarios for the 'Forgot Password' request flow, addressing common user interactions and error handling. However, it lacks comprehensive coverage of security vulnerabilities and performance testing under high-load conditions, limiting its effectiveness in ensuring system robustness and security.
Feedback: Incorporate security testing to address vulnerabilities like brute force attacks, phishing scenarios, and secure email delivery with encryption., Enhance performance testing by simulating high-load conditions and concurrent requests to evaluate the system's handling of peak traffic and rate limiting.
