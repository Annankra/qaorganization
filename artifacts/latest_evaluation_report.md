--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 8/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission offers a comprehensive approach to the 'Forgot Password' request flow, including functional scenarios, threat modeling, and performance testing. However, it lacks sufficient security testing against unauthorized access and brute force attacks, and the performance load test failed, suggesting the need for further optimization.
Feedback: Enhance security testing by adding scenarios for brute force protection, unauthorized access, and strengthening the rate limiting mechanism., Investigate the causes of the performance load test failure and address potential bottlenecks. Consider expanding the test plan to include higher-load and longer-duration scenarios to better assess system scalability.
