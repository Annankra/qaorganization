--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 8/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission provides a thorough approach to testing user authentication with MFA and password recovery, incorporating functional, security, and threat modeling analyses. It effectively uses the STRIDE model to identify potential threats and provides comprehensive functional scenarios. However, it could benefit from additional edge case testing and continuous updates to threat models.
Feedback: Expand functional test scenarios to include edge cases such as network failures during MFA token delivery and handling of compromised recovery channels., Continuously update threat models to reflect evolving threats and conduct real-world attack simulations to validate the effectiveness of security controls.
