--- Mission Evaluation (Score: 7/10) ---
Rationale: The QA mission provides a strong foundation with comprehensive functional scenarios and utilizes STRIDE for threat modeling. However, it lacks thorough coverage of concurrent operations, security-specific scenarios, and higher-load performance testing. These gaps limit the overall effectiveness of the testing strategy.
Feedback: Expand functional test scenarios to include concurrent operations and security-specific tests, such as SQL injection and XSS during profile updates., Include higher-load and longer-duration performance tests to assess scalability and identify potential bottlenecks, and improve logging for detailed diagnostics.
