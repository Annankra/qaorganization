Rationale: The QA mission provides a comprehensive approach to testing the password reset feature, covering functional scenarios, security threat modeling, and usability considerations. It effectively identifies potential threats and recommends appropriate security controls. However, it can be further improved by including more detailed security-focused tests and concurrent execution scenarios.
Feedback: Expand the functional test suite to include concurrent password reset requests and intricate security tests such as SQL Injection and XSS., Regularly update threat models with real-world attack scenarios and integrate recent security intelligence to enhance the security posture.
